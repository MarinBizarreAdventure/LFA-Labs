#### Overview
A finite automaton is a mechanism used to represent processes of different kinds. It can be compared to a state machine as they both have similar structures and purpose as well. The word finite signifies the fact that an automaton comes with a starting and a set of final states. In other words, for a process modeled by an automaton, there is a clear beginning and ending.

Based on the structure of an automaton, non-determinism can arise when one transition leads to multiple states. Determinism characterizes how predictable a system is, and if randomness is involved, the system becomes non-deterministic. However, it's possible to achieve determinism through algorithms that modify the structure of the automaton.

#### Objectives:
- Understand the concept and usage of automata.
- Implement functions for classifying grammars based on Chomsky hierarchy.
- Convert finite automata to regular grammars.
- Determine if a finite automaton is deterministic or non-deterministic.
- Convert non-deterministic finite automata (NDFA) to deterministic finite automata (DFA).
- Represent finite automata graphically.

#### Implementation Description
- **Classification Function:** Implemented a function to classify grammars based on the Chomsky hierarchy.
- **Conversion to Regular Grammar:** Developed functionality to convert finite automata to regular grammars.
- **Determinism Check:** Implemented logic to determine whether a finite automaton is deterministic or non-deterministic.
- **NDFA to DFA Conversion:** Implemented functionality to convert non-deterministic finite automata (NDFA) to deterministic finite automata (DFA).
- **Graphical Representation:** Utilized external libraries/tools/APIs to represent finite automata graphically.



#### Conclusions
This laboratory work provided valuable insights into the concepts of determinism in finite automata and the conversion process from non-deterministic to deterministic finite automata. By implementing functions to classify grammars, convert automata, and visualize them graphically, we gained a deeper understanding of formal languages and automata theory.
