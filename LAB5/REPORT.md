# Regular Expressions Laboratory Report

**Author:** Negai Marin  

## Theory

Regular expressions are a powerful tool used for pattern matching in strings. They consist of a sequence of characters that define a search pattern, allowing you to find specific patterns within text data. Regular expressions are widely used in programming, text processing, and data validation tasks.

## Objectives

The objectives of this laboratory work are as follows:
1. Understand the concept and usage of regular expressions.
2. Write a code that generates valid combinations of symbols conforming to given regular expressions.
3. Implement a function that shows the sequence of processing a regular expression.

## Implementation Description

### Generating Valid Combinations of Symbols:
To generate valid combinations of symbols based on provided regular expressions, we implemented a Python function that recursively constructs valid strings following the given pattern. The function parses the regular expression and handles special characters such as '*', '+', and '^' to generate all possible combinations of symbols that match the pattern.

### Function for Showing Processing Sequence:
The function developed to show the sequence of processing a regular expression provides insight into the steps performed during pattern matching. It demonstrates how the regular expression engine processes the input text and identifies matches based on the defined pattern. This function is instrumental in understanding the inner workings of regular expressions and how they are applied in practical scenarios.

In conclusion, this laboratory work focused on understanding and implementing regular expressions in Python. By exploring the concept of regular expressions and their usage, we gained insight into their importance in text processing and pattern matching tasks. The implementation of functions to generate valid combinations of symbols and to demonstrate the sequence of processing a regular expression provided practical experience in working with regular expressions.

Through this laboratory work, we enhanced our understanding of regular expressions and their applications in real-world scenarios. By completing the objectives outlined in the assignment, we developed practical skills in using regular expressions effectively in programming tasks. This experience will be valuable in future projects and tasks that involve text processing, data validation, and pattern matching.

## Conclusion

Overall, this laboratory work provided a comprehensive overview of regular expressions and their implementation in Python, contributing to our proficiency in formal languages and finite automata.
